## ✨ Features

- **Modern Dark Interface**: Built with `CustomTkinter` for a sleek, game-themed appearance.
- **Three Unique Workflows**: Seamlessly switch between generating brand new outfits via AI, getting creative inspiration for your styles, and grouping your existing mods into single multi-mods.
- **Granular Generation Control**: Individually toggle the generation of Diffuse (Color), Specular (Material/Gloss), and Normal (3D Bump) maps to save API requests or regenerate specific parts.
- **Customizable AI Models**: Choose exactly which Gemini AI model processes your request (e.g., `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` or other supported models).
- **Network Resilience**: Built-in 10-minute SDK timeout patches and automatic 3-attempt API retry loops ensure your generations don't fail due to temporary Google API server congestion or `503/504 Deadline Exceeded` errors.
- **No Terminal Required**: Configures all paths and handles logging automatically.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: The UI remains responsive while the outfit is being generated via AI or while mods are being grouped.
- **Standalone Executable**: Easily package the app into a single `.exe` file that any Windows user can run out-of-the-box.

## 🚀 Quick Start (For Users)

1. [Download the latest `HaydeeOutfitGenerator.exe` release](https://github.com/thegamerbay/haydee-ai-outfit-generator-gui/releases).
2. Launch the application.
3. Fill in the **Settings** panel:
   - Your **Gemini API Key**.
   - Path to your **Haydee** game installation directory.
   - Your **Author Name** (Optional, applied to all generated or grouped mods).
   - Your **AI Model** (Defaults to `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview`).
4. Click **Save Settings**.
5. Choose your workflow tab:
   - **✨ Generate Outfit**: Enter a unique mod name, a descriptive style prompt, and toggle which textures you want to generate (Diffuse, Specular, or Normal) before starting.
   - ** Prompt Ideas**: Feeling stuck? Enter a simple theme (like "Cyberpunk") and get AI-generated outfit concepts. Apply ideas directly to the generator with one click.
   - **📦 Group Mods**: Combine multiple existing mods into one multi-mod. Enter the new multi-mod name, the source mods to group (e.g., `red, green, blue`), and the slot category (e.g., `color`).
6. Click **Start Generation**, **Generate Prompt Ideas**, or **Group Outfits** and watch the magic happen in the built-in console window!

*(Note: The app will automatically save your settings in `AppData/Local/HaydeeOutfitGenerator/settings.json` so you don't have to enter your details every time.)*

3. Click the "Create API key" button.
4. If prompted, read and accept the terms of service.
